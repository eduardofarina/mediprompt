Analyze patient information carefully and systematically\n2. Generate comprehensive differential diagnoses based on findings\n3. Recommend appropriate diagnostic tests and management steps\n4. Explain your reasoning process explicitly at each step\n\nFollow these general principles:\n- Consider the most common diagnoses first, but don't overlook rare but critical conditions\n- Account for the patient's demographics, risk factors, and comorbidities\n- Distinguish between causative factors and coincidental findings\n- Quantify uncertainty and provide clear confidence levels for your assessments\n- Consider both supporting and contradicting evidence for each hypothesis\n\nWhen analyzing cases, think step-by-step and explain your reasoning explicitly.",

      "how_to_apply": [
        "1. Categorize the pain: Use questions to determine if the pain is visceral, parietal, or referred.",
        "2. Localize the pain: Identify the quadrant or region of the abdomen where the pain is most pronounced.",
        "3. Develop a preliminary differential: Based on age and pain location, list common causes of acute abdominal pain.",
        "4. Collect vital signs: Obtain and analyze vital signs to assess the severity and potential urgency of the condition.",
        "5. Perform a targeted physical exam: Focus on key findings such as rebound tenderness, guarding, or distension.",
        "6. Review past medical history: Quickly check for any relevant history that might influence the current condition.",
        "7. Initial lab tests: Order basic labs such as complete blood count (CBC) and urinalysis to gather more data.",
        "8. Monitor and re-evaluate: Continuously assess the patient\u2019s condition and refine the differential based on new information."

      "example": "A young adult presents with acute abdominal pain. The clinician first categorizes the pain as visceral, localizes it to the right lower quadrant, and considers appendicitis, ovarian torsion, or ectopic pregnancy as potential causes. Vital signs show mild tachycardia, prompting further investigation with a CBC and abdominal ultrasound.",

        "Start with a broad differential diagnosis considering conditions that could cause systemic inflammation.",
        "Evaluate the patient's history for any recent infections, autoimmune conditions, or other systemic illnesses.",
        "Consider common causes of elevated inflammatory markers such as infections, inflammatory diseases, and malignancies.",

      "example": "A patient presents with diffuse pain and an unremarkable physical exam, but elevated C-reactive protein. The clinician considers systemic diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus and orders ANA and rheumatoid factor tests.

        "Step 1: Identify and list all missing or incomplete data elements that are critical for diagnosis (e.g., specific symptoms, vital signs, lab results).",
        "Step 2: Prioritize the missing data based on their potential impact on narrowing down the differential diagnosis.",
        "Step 3: Develop a plan to obtain the missing information, such as ordering additional tests, conducting thorough patient interviews, or reviewing medical records.",
        "Step 4: Use available information to maintain a broad and inclusive differential diagnosis until more data is collected.",
        "Step 5: Reassess the situation regularly as new information is obtained to update the differential diagnosis and recommendations."

      "example": "A patient presents with generalized weakness, but their lab results have not yet returned. The clinician lists this as missing data, prioritizes it, and orders a complete blood count and metabolic panel. Meanwhile, the clinician keeps a broad differential, considering anemia, electrolyte imbalance, and endocrine disorders. Once lab results are available, the clinician narrows the differential and makes targeted treatment recommendations.",

The clinician asks about recent upper respiratory symptoms, heartburn, and symptom triggers. The patient reports cough worse after meals and at night, leading to a higher suspicion of GERD.",

Alternative diagnoses to consider include aortic dissection, pulmonary embolism, pneumothorax, or pericarditis, but the symptom constellation and risk factors make ACS most likely.",
