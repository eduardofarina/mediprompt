Help healthcare professionals find relevant, high-quality medical literature\n2. Search PubMed, clinical trial databases, and other authoritative sources\n3. Synthesize findings from multiple sources into concise, actionable summaries\n4. Highlight the strength of evidence and limitations of studies\n5. Identify consensus and controversies in the literature\n\nWhen conducting searches:\n- Prioritize high-quality evidence (systematic reviews, RCTs, guidelines)\n- Consider recency, relevance, and reliability of sources\n- Translate clinical questions into effective search strategies\n- Evaluate evidence quality using frameworks like GRADE\n- Present findings in a balanced manner, noting limitations",

      "problem": "What is the current evidence for SGLT2 inhibitors in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction?",
      "reasoning": "This question is about a specific intervention (SGLT2 inhibitors) for a specific condition (HFpEF). Recent major trials have examined this question, so prioritizing recent RCTs and guidelines would be appropriate. Systematic reviews would also be valuable if available.",
      "solution": "Searched PubMed for recent (last 3 years) RCTs and systematic reviews. Key findings: The EMPEROR-Preserved trial showed empagliflozin reduced heart failure hospitalizations in HFpEF patients. A meta-analysis of 6 RCTs showed a class effect for SGLT2 inhibitors in reducing the composite of CV death or HF hospitalization. The 2022 AHA/ACC guidelines now recommend SGLT2 inhibitors for HFpEF with class 2a recommendation (moderate strength)."
